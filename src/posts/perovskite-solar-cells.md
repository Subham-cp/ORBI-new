Perovskite Solar Cells: A Bright Future for Renewable Energy
The global demand for sustainable energy sources has never been higher. Among the various emerging technologies, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable power conversion efficiencies, which are rapidly approaching those of traditional silicon solar cells.

Why Perovskites?
Perovskite materials possess unique optoelectronic properties that make them highly efficient at converting sunlight into electricity. Key advantages include:

High efficiency: Rapid improvements in lab-scale efficiency.

Low manufacturing cost: Can be processed using low-temperature, solution-based methods.

Flexibility: Potential for flexible and transparent solar cells.

Challenges and Our Research
Despite their promise, PSCs face challenges related to long-term stability and scalability for mass production. Our research group is actively working on:

Improving material stability against moisture and heat.

Developing new encapsulation techniques to protect the active layer.

Exploring large-area fabrication methods suitable for industrial scale.

Our goal is to overcome these hurdles and contribute to the commercialization of highly efficient and durable perovskite solar cell technology, accelerating the transition to a clean energy future.
